Objective:

Implement the is_free, is_set, set_bit, clear_bit functions.

complete the code for __str__ function. That will help you debug. print(a) where 
the object a is of type mybit_vector, will print according to the comments above 
this function.


You can use the test.py to test the code. However, pls note that the verification 
process uses your own code and thus if your code is wrong, it will be wrong for 
ever. However it shows the logic of how you should verify things. 
The backend testing in codepost may use a different methodology of testing.


The code is well commented for you to understand. 
Write more test cases than given in the test.py if required.
